# MARN-Stack-MongoDb-ApolloServer-React
MARN Stack is the next generation of popular MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Using Apollo Server instead of Express.js makes it very easy to create GraphQL APIs.

This project uses Apollo Server instead of Express. Everything has its pros and cons. I like Apollo Server for its ease of setup, GraphiQL console (very useful during development), and support for many front-end frameworks.
